The flower is said to take on vivid colors if it gets plenty of nutrition and sunlight.

It breathes fire of such great heat that it melts anything. However, it never turns its fiery breath on any opponent weaker than itself.'),(7,26,9,'Squirtle’s shell is not merely used for protection.

The tail becomes increasingly deeper in color as Wartortle ages.

They can shoot bullets of water with enough accuracy to strike empty cans from a distance of over 160 feet.'),(10,26,9,'Caterpie has a voracious appetite. It can devour leaves bigger than its body right before your eyes. From its antenna, this Pokémon releases a terrifically strong odor.'),(11,26,9,'The shell covering this Pokémon’s body is as hard as an iron slab. Metapod does not move very much.

Many Trainers are captivated by the striking beauty of the feathers on its head, compelling them to choose Pidgeot as their Pokémon.'),(19,26,9,'Rattata is cautious in the extreme.

To keep them ground down, it gnaws on rocks and logs. It may even chew on the walls of houses.'),(21,26,9,'Spearow has a very loud cry that can be heard over half a mile away.

Assuming this position allows it to quickly respond to a threat from any direction with a glare from its upraised head.'),(24,26,9,'This Pokémon is terrifically strong in order to constrict things with its body. It can even flatten steel oil drums. Once Arbok wraps its body around its foe, escaping its crunching embrace is impossible.'),(25,26,9,'This Pokémon has electricity-storing pouches on its cheeks. These appear to become electrically charged during the night while Pikachu sleeps. It occasionally discharges electricity when it is dozy after waking up.'),(26,26,9,'This Pokémon exudes a weak electrical charge from all over its body that makes it take on a slight glow in darkness.

At night, it burrows into the desert sand to sleep.'),(28,26,9,'Sandslash can roll up its body as if it were a ball covered with large spikes.

It then leaps at the stunned foe to tear wildly with its sharp claws.'),(29,26,9,'Nidoran-f has barbs that secrete a powerful poison. They are thought to have developed as protection for this small-bodied Pokémon.

If it is in a battle against an opponent that does not easily fall asleep, Jigglypuff cannot breathe, endangering its life.'),(40,26,9,'Wigglytuff’s body is very flexible. By inhaling deeply, this Pokémon can inflate itself seemingly without end.

During the daytime, it stays in caves or under the eaves of old houses, sleeping while hanging upside down.'),(42,26,9,'Golbat bites down on prey with its four fangs and drinks the victim’s blood. It becomes active on inky dark moonless nights, flying around to attack people and Pokémon.'),(43,26,9,'Oddish searches for fertile, nutrient-rich soil, then plants itself. During the daytime, while it is planted, this Pokémon’s feet are thought to change shape and become similar to the roots of trees.'),(44,26,9,'From its mouth Gloom drips honey that smells absolutely horrible. Apparently, it loves the horrid stench. It sniffs the noxious fumes and then drools even more of its honey.'),(45,26,9,'Vileplume has the world’s largest petals. They are used to attract prey that are then doused with toxic spores. Once the prey are immobilized, this Pokémon catches and devours them.'),(46,26,9,'Paras has parasitic mushrooms growing on its back called tochukaso. They grow large by drawing nutrients from this Bug Pokémon host. They are highly valued as a medicine for extending life.'),(47,26,9,'Parasect is known to infest large trees en masse and drain nutrients from the lower trunk and roots. When an infested tree dies, they move onto another tree all at once.'),(48,26,9,'Venonat is said to have evolved with a coat of thin, stiff hair that covers its entire body for protection. It possesses large eyes that never fail to spot even minuscule prey.'),(49,26,9,'Venomoth is nocturnal—it is a Pokémon that only becomes active at night. Its favorite prey are small insects that gather around streetlights, attracted by the light in the darkness.'),(50,26,9,'Diglett are raised in most farms. The reason is simple— wherever this Pokémon burrows, the soil is left perfectly tilled for planting crops. This soil is made ideal for growing delicious vegetables.'),(51,26,9,'Dugtrio are actually triplets that emerged from one body. As a result, each triplet thinks exactly like the other two triplets. They work cooperatively to burrow endlessly.'),(52,26,9,'Meowth withdraws its sharp claws into its paws to slinkily sneak about without making any incriminating footsteps. For some reason, this Pokémon loves shiny coins that glitter with light.'),(53,26,9,'Persian has six bold whiskers that give it a look of toughness.

In turn, its muscles are made even stronger. However, it also becomes much less intelligent at the same time.'),(58,26,9,'Growlithe has a superb sense of smell.

It uses its advanced olfactory sense to determine the emotions of other living things.'),(59,26,9,'Arcanine is known for its high speed.

The fire that blazes wildly within this Pokémon’s body is its source of power.'),(60,26,9,'Poliwag has a very thin skin. It is possible to see the Pokémon’s spiral innards right through the skin. Despite its thinness, however, the skin is also very flexible. Even sharp fangs bounce right off it.'),(61,26,9,'The surface of Poliwhirl’s body is always wet and slick with a slimy fluid. Because of this slippery covering, it can easily slip and slide out of the clutches of any enemy in battle.'),(62,26,9,'Poliwrath’s highly developed, brawny muscles never grow fatigued, however much it exercises. It is so tirelessly strong, this Pokémon can swim back and forth across the ocean without effort.'),(63,26,9,'Abra needs to sleep for eighteen hours a day.

If it is attacked, Abra escapes using Teleport while it is still sleeping.'),(64,26,9,'Kadabra holds a silver spoon in its hand. The spoon is used to amplify the alpha waves in its brain. Without the spoon, the Pokémon is said to be limited to half the usual amount of its telekinetic powers.'),(65,26,9,'Alakazam’s brain continually grows, infinitely multiplying brain cells.
